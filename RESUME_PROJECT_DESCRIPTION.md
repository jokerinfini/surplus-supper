# 🍽️ Surplus Supper - Resume Project Description

## 📋 **Project Overview**

**Surplus Supper** is a full-stack marketplace platform that connects restaurants with customers to reduce food waste by selling surplus food at discounted prices. Built with modern technologies and deployed on production-ready infrastructure.

## 🏗️ **Technical Stack**

### **Backend**
- **Language**: Go 1.21+ (Golang)
- **Framework**: Standard library with Gorilla Mux
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with automated migrations
- **Authentication**: JWT with bcrypt password hashing
- **API**: RESTful API with CORS support
- **Deployment**: Railway (Production-ready)

### **Frontend**
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript for type safety
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom glassmorphism design
- **Animations**: Framer Motion and Three.js for 3D effects
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Components**: Shadcn/ui component library
- **Deployment**: Vercel (Edge network, global CDN)

### **Infrastructure**
